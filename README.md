## Hidden Pokemon 
Hidden Pokemon is a hidden objects themed game where players are supposed to find the listed Pokemon among a scene. By clicking on the sprites generated by the Pokemon API,
players gain points to win. The game uses HTML, CSS, and JS.

### API
Pokemon API to randomly generate Pokemon sprites and attached names.

### Features
1) Score
2) Pokemon sprites
3) List of Pokemon to find
4) Background environment image

### Stretch goals 
1) Location of Pokemon is truly randomized
2) Additional Pokemon added/additional difficulty levels

### Installation
Fork and clone https://github.com/PurpleTatsu/Hidden-Objects-Language-Game

### Approach
I created an array using Math.random to generate seven Pokemon ids, as they would appear on the Pokemon API. From there I created a for loop so I could call a random Pokemon seven times. Then I created and appended divs and a list for each Pokemon. I used a click function to erase Pokemon after clicking, and another to track the score.

### Issues
Game is not compatible for multiple media queries and barely compatible for desktop use.
Sprites are stationary in a line, and locations are not randomly generated.
Problems with background image functioning with sprites.
